# -I . says to include everything in ./ as potential headers and reference from

# SOURCES are the files you want R CMD SHLIB to compile. We want to compile 
# everything in the src/ top level directory and at each sublevel that is 
# a *.cpp file. There are "better" ways to do this so we don't have to list
# each sublevel, but this is fine for me.

# to all become .o files in the same location as their .cpp counterpart.
